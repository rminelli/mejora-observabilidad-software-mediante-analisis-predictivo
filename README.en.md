# Improving Software Observability through Predictive Analysis

This repository contains the source code and practical examples related to the Final Master's Project (TFM) titled **"Improving Software Observability through Predictive Analysis: Anomaly Detection, Failure Forecasting, and Performance Optimization"**.

The project focuses on applying predictive analysis techniques to enhance software observability in automotive systems.

## Academic Background

This TFM is part of the **MBA with a specialization in Business Intelligence and Big Data** studies at the [Instituto Europeo de Posgrado (IEP)](https://iep.edu.es/), leading to a **triple degree**:
- **MBA and Executive Master's in Business Intelligence and Big Data** from the [Instituto Europeo de Posgrado (IEP)](https://iep.edu.es/).
- **Executive Program in Business Administration** from [Summa University (USA)](https://summauniversity.us/).  

## Authors
- **Roberto Minelli**
- **Omar Herazo Mestra**

## Project Description

The goal of this TFM is to apply advanced machine learning techniques to:
- Detect anomalies in automotive software using PCA and K-Means.
- Forecast failures in the software system through an LSTM Neural Network.
- Optimize software performance using Decision Tree models.

The methods and algorithms implemented in this repository enable the identification of anomalous patterns, forecasting failures before they occur, and improving the efficiency of automotive software, contributing to vehicle safety and reliability.

## Repository Content

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/anomaly_detection/**: Contains the code and scripts related to anomaly detection using PCA and K-Means.
- **/failure_forecasting/**: Includes the LSTM model developed for failure forecasting in automotive software systems.
- **/performance_optimization/**: Contains scripts for performance optimization using Decision Tree models.
- **/data/**: Sample input data used to train and test the models.
- **README.md**: General project description and instructions on how to use the code in this repository.

## Requirements

To run the code included in this repository, it is recommended to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Python libraries:
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `tensorflow`
    - `keras`
    - `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each subfolder contains an example file that demonstrates how to run the corresponding code. Below is a basic guide on how to use each technique:

1. **Anomaly Detection**:
    - Navigate to the `anomaly_detection/` folder and run `pca_kmeans.py` to see how anomaly detection is implemented using PCA and K-Means.

2. **Failure Forecasting**:
    - Go to the `failure_forecasting/` folder and run `lstm_forecasting.py` to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

3. ** Performance Optimization**:
    - Navigate to the `performance_optimization/` folder and run `decision_tree_optimization.py` to see how performance optimization is implemented using Decision Trees.

## Results
The results obtained from each model are documented in the TFM, demonstrating how these predictive techniques can improve the observability and performance of automotive software. The full implementation and the graphs generated by the models are also available in the corresponding subfolders.
